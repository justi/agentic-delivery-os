# Feature: Decision Records Management

## Overview

ADOS provides a tracker-agnostic standard for recording and managing significant project decisions. The system supports five decision types — Architecture (ADR), Product (PDR), Technical (TDR), Business (BDR), and Operational (ODR) — all co-located in a flat `doc/decisions/` directory. The standard includes a management guide, a reusable template, agent tooling integration, and a defined lifecycle.

## Business Context

### Problem Statement

- **Problem:** Significant decisions lack durable documentation, causing repeated debates, lost institutional knowledge, and onboarding friction.
- **Affected Users:** Engineers, architects, product owners, and new team members.
- **Business Impact:** Without decision records, teams lose the rationale behind architectural and product choices when team members rotate.

### Goals & Success Metrics

- **Primary Goal:** Every precedent-setting decision has a discoverable, structured record with context, alternatives, and rationale.
- **KPIs:** Decision records directory exists and is integrated with agent tooling (`@architect`, `/plan-decision`, `/write-decision`).

## User Experience & Functionality

### Decision Types

| Type | Prefix | Scope |
|------|--------|-------|
| Architecture Decision Record | `ADR` | System design, infrastructure patterns, API boundaries |
| Product Decision Record | `PDR` | Feature scoping, UX strategy, product positioning |
| Technical Decision Record | `TDR` | Technology choices, libraries, implementation approach |
| Business Decision Record | `BDR` | Business rules, compliance, process policies |
| Operational Decision Record | `ODR` | Infrastructure, deployment, monitoring, incident response |

### Capabilities

- **Structured authoring (F-1):** Template with front-matter skeleton and required sections (Context, Problem Framing, Decision Drivers, Alternatives, Decision, Consequences, Verification Criteria).
- **Lifecycle management (F-2):** Status transitions from Proposed → Under Review → Accepted → (Deprecated | Superseded).
- **Immutability after acceptance (F-3):** Accepted decisions are not modified; changes create new superseding records.
- **Cross-linking (F-4):** Decision records link to change specs via `links.related_changes` and vice versa via `links.decisions`.
- **Agent integration (F-5):** `@architect` creates records via `/plan-decision` + `/write-decision`; records target `doc/decisions/`.
- **Index maintenance (F-6):** `doc/decisions/00-index.md` provides a table of all records.

### Naming Convention

```
<TYPE>-<zeroPad4>-<slug>.md
```

- Each type has its own sequence (ADR-0001 and PDR-0001 can coexist)
- Numbers are never reused
- Slug is kebab-case, max 60 characters

Examples: `ADR-0001-event-bus-selection.md`, `PDR-0001-free-tier-scope.md`

### Lifecycle

```
Proposed → Under Review → Accepted → (Deprecated | Superseded)
```

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Proposed | Initial draft; open for discussion |
| Under Review | Actively being reviewed by stakeholders |
| Accepted | Finalized; teams should follow it |
| Deprecated | No longer applicable; preserved for history |
| Superseded | Replaced by a newer record (linked via `superseded_by`) |

### Governance

| Decision Type | Reviewers |
|--------------|-----------|
| ADR | Architecture lead, affected service owners |
| PDR | Product owner, engineering lead |
| TDR | Tech lead, affected developers |
| BDR | Product owner, business stakeholders |
| ODR | SRE/platform lead, affected service owners |

### When to Create a Decision Record

Create a record when a decision is hard to reverse, has cross-component impact, involves trade-offs, changes security posture, introduces a new dependency, or is likely to be questioned later. Do not create records for implementation details, bug fixes, or documentation-only changes.

## Technical Architecture & Codebase Map

### Core Components

| Path | Component | Responsibility |
|------|-----------|----------------|
| `doc/decisions/` | Decision records directory | Flat directory containing all decision records, co-located by type prefix |
| `doc/decisions/README.md` | Directory overview | Purpose, naming convention, lifecycle summary, and references |
| `doc/decisions/00-index.md` | Index | Table of all decision records with ID, type, title, status, date, owners |
| `doc/guides/decision-records-management.md` | Management guide | Full standard: types, naming, lifecycle, front matter, required sections, governance |
| `doc/templates/decision-record-template.md` | Authoring template | Reusable template with front-matter skeleton, all sections, and inline HTML-comment guidance |
| `.opencode/agent/architect.md` | Architect agent | Creates decision records; targets `doc/decisions/` |
| `.opencode/command/write-decision.md` | Write Decision command | Generates decision record from planning context |
| `.opencode/command/plan-decision.md` | Plan Decision command | Interactive decision planning session |

### Front Matter Schema

```yaml
id: ADR-0001
decision_type: adr          # adr | pdr | tdr | bdr | odr
status: Proposed             # Proposed | Under Review | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
created: 2026-03-10
decision_date: null          # Set when Accepted
last_updated: 2026-03-10
summary: "Short one-line summary"
owners: ["team-platform"]
service: "delivery-os"
links:
  related_changes: []        # workItemRef identifiers
  supersedes: []             # Decision IDs this record replaces
  superseded_by: []          # Decision IDs that replace this record
  spec: []                   # Related spec paths
  contracts: []              # Related contract paths
  diagrams: []               # Related diagram paths
  decisions: []              # Other related decision record IDs
```

### Required Sections

1. Title (`# <TYPE>-<zeroPad4>: <Title>`)
2. Context
3. Problem Framing
4. Decision Drivers
5. Alternatives Considered (at least 2 options + do-nothing baseline)
6. Decision
7. Consequences (positive, negative, unresolved)
8. Verification Criteria
9. Status
10. References

## Non-Functional Requirements

| ID | Category | Requirement | Threshold |
|----|----------|-------------|-----------|
| NFR-1 | Completeness | Guide defines all 5 decision types with lifecycle, naming, and governance | 100% coverage |
| NFR-2 | Template validity | Template renders as valid GitHub-flavored Markdown | All sections present |
| NFR-3 | Agent alignment | `@architect`, `/write-decision`, `/plan-decision` all target `doc/decisions/` | Zero references to `doc/adr/` |

## Quality Assurance Strategy

### Testing Approach

| Level | Scope | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Manual | Template validation | Copy template to `doc/decisions/`; verify all sections render correctly |
| Manual | Agent workflow | Run `/plan-decision` + `/write-decision`; verify output lands in `doc/decisions/` with correct naming |
| Search | Reference consistency | Grep for `doc/adr/` across repo; expect zero matches |

## Dependencies & Risks

- **Depends on:** `@architect` agent for automated creation workflow
- **Depends on:** Document templates feature for the decision record template
- **Risk:** Process overhead may discourage adoption — mitigated by lightweight design (single template, flat directory, familiar lifecycle)
