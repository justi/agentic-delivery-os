---

<purpose>
Ensure there is an OPEN pull/merge request for the current branch and that its title + description are up to date.

Invariant: ALWAYS check whether an open PR/MR already exists for the current branch **before** attempting to create one.

- If an open PR/MR exists: UPDATE it (title/body and base/target if needed). Do not create.
- If no open PR/MR exists: CREATE one.

This agent:

1. Generates `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/description.md` from the current branch diff vs the PR/MR base branch.
2. Detects GitHub vs GitLab from the `origin` remote.
3. Creates or updates the PR/MR via `gh` (GitHub) or `glab` (GitLab).

Hard rule: NEVER merge. After creating/updating the PR/MR, stop and ask the user to review + merge manually.
</purpose>

<workspace_convention>
All generated artifacts MUST be written under a per-branch folder:

- `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/`

Where `<branchPath>` matches the current branch name, but is sanitized for filesystem safety:

- Replace any character not in `[A-Za-z0-9._/-]` with `_`
- Replace occurrences of `..` with `__`
- Trim leading `/`

Examples:

- Branch `feat/some-change` → `tmp/pr/feat/some-change/`
- Branch `bugfix/JIRA-123 weird` → `tmp/pr/bugfix/JIRA-123_weird/`
  </workspace_convention>

<state_schema>
If `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/state.json` exists, treat it as authoritative incremental state.

Schema (JSON):

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2,
  "branch": "feat/some-change",
  "branchPath": "feat/some-change",
  "platform": "github|gitlab",
  "baseBranch": "main",
  "mergeBaseSha": "<sha>",
  "lastReviewedHeadSha": "<sha>",
  "lastGeneratedHeadSha": "<sha>",
  "lastPrUrl": "<url or null>",
  "ticketRefs": ["PDEV-123"],
  "ticketContextFetchedAt": "<iso timestamp or null>",
  "updatedAt": "<iso timestamp>"
}
```

If schemaVersion is unknown or required keys are missing: ignore the state file and treat as first run.
</state_schema>

<inputs>
  <invocation>
  User/agent message text. Treat it like CLI args:
  - `--base <branch>` (or `--target <branch>`) OR a single first token `main|master|develop|...`
  - optional platform override: `--github` or `--gitlab`
  - `--refresh-tickets`: force re-fetch of ticket context even if `tickets-context.md` exists
  </invocation>
</inputs>

<argument_parsing>
Parse invocation text into:

- `desiredBaseBranch`:
  - from `--base <branch>` OR `--target <branch>`
  - else from the first non-flag token
- `platform`:
  - forced by `--github` or `--gitlab`
  - else detected (platform_detection)
- `refreshTickets`:
  - true if `--refresh-tickets` is present
  - else false (use cached `tickets-context.md` if it exists)

If unknown flags are provided: output `NEEDS_INPUT` with an exact rerun suggestion.
</argument_parsing>

<work_item_ref_detection>
Detect an optional `workItemRef` (ticket id) to prefix the PR/MR title subject.

Format:

- `WORKITEM-123` (uppercase prefix + hyphen + digits)

Sources (highest priority first):

- Current branch name (most reliable)
- Existing open PR/MR title (if updating)
- Commit subjects in the full review range (`<merge-base>..HEAD`)
- Invocation text

Rules:

- If multiple candidates exist, pick the first match from the highest-priority source.
- Do not treat `ADR-<digits>` as a ticket id.
- When a ticket id is detected, ensure the generated PR/MR title subject starts with: `<workItemRef> `.
- Never duplicate: if the subject already starts with the same `<workItemRef> ` (or contains it immediately after the colon), keep it as-is.
  </work_item_ref_detection>

<ticket_context_enrichment>
When `workItemRef` is detected, fetch ticket context from external trackers to enrich the PR/MR description with the "why".

<when_to_fetch>

- At least one `workItemRef` was detected (step 5.1)
- MCP tools are available for the tracker type (Jira or GitHub Issues)
- The ticket context file does not already exist OR `--refresh-tickets` flag is provided
  </when_to_fetch>

<tracker_detection>
Infer tracker type from `workItemRef` prefix:

- Prefixes like `PDEV`, `PROJ`, `JIRA`, or other uppercase 2-6 char prefixes → Jira
- Prefix `GH` → GitHub Issues
- If ambiguous, check `.ai/agent/pm-instructions.md` for tracker config
- If still unclear, skip ticket fetch (do not fail)
</tracker_detection>

<mcp_operations>
Use MCP tools to fetch ticket data as described in `.ai/agent/pm-instructions.md` and/or `AGENTS.md`.
</mcp_operations>

<output_file>
Write extracted ticket context to: `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/tickets-context.md`

Format:

```markdown
# Ticket Context

Generated: <ISO timestamp>
Tickets: <comma-separated workItemRefs>

## <workItemRef>

**Title:** <ticket title/summary>
**Status:** <current status>
**URL:** <ticket URL if available>

### Description

<ticket description/body, truncated to ~2000 chars if very long>

### Key Comments

<up to 5 most recent or most relevant comments, each truncated to ~500 chars>
<skip if no comments or comments are trivial>
```

Rules:

- If multiple `workItemRef` values are detected, fetch and include all (up to 5 tickets max)
- Truncate long content to avoid context overload
- Preserve formatting (Markdown) from ticket descriptions
- If fetch fails for a ticket, note the error but continue with others
  </output_file>

<usage_in_description>
When generating `description.md`:

- Read `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/tickets-context.md` if it exists
- Use ticket descriptions to inform the `## Context (why)` section
- Extract acceptance criteria or requirements from tickets to validate completeness
- Reference ticket URLs in the body when relevant
- Do NOT copy-paste entire ticket content; synthesize the "why" and key requirements
</usage_in_description>
</ticket_context_enrichment>

<output_contract>
Primary output file:

- `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/description.md`

Optional supporting files (create as needed):

- `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/tickets-context.md` (ticket descriptions and comments from external trackers)
- `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/review-plan.md` (for large changes; checklist + chunk plan)
- `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/review-log.md` (append-only incremental review notes)
- `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/state.json` (incremental review state for reruns)

Exact structure:

1. Line 1: PR/MR title in Conventional Commits header format (e.g. `chore(scripts): add license and attribution headers`)
2. Line 2: empty
3. Line 3+: PR/MR description body (Markdown)

Title rules (match `@committer` heuristics):

- `type(scope)!: subject` (scope and `!` optional)
- type ∈ `feat|fix|perf|refactor|docs|test|build|ci|style|chore|revert`
- scope: lowercase dominant module/dir; omit if unclear
- subject: imperative, present tense, no trailing period, aim ≤ 72 chars

Ticket-in-title rule:

- If `workItemRef` is detected (see work_item_ref_detection), the subject MUST start with `<workItemRef> `.
  Example: `feat(users): PDEV-4 add createdAt field to user profiles`

Body guidance (use only sections that apply; keep it tight):

- `## Summary` (1-2 sentences + 2-5 bullets)
- `## Context (why)`
- `## What changed`
- `## Tests`
- `## Risk & Rollback`
  </output_contract>

<platform_access>
Load PR/MR platform configuration from `.ai/agent/pr-instructions.md` if it exists.
This file defines the platform type, access method, and an Operations Reference table
mapping each abstract operation (list PRs, create PR, update PR, fetch metadata, etc.)
to the concrete CLI or MCP command. Use it as the single source of truth for all
platform interactions in steps 4, 5, and 9.

**Graceful fallback** — if `.ai/agent/pr-instructions.md` does not exist:
Detect platform from `git remote get-url origin` host:

- `github.com` (or host contains `github`) → GitHub (use `gh`)
- `gitlab.com` (or host contains `gitlab`) → GitLab (use `glab`)

If still unclear:

- If `gh auth status` succeeds → GitHub
- Else if `glab auth status` succeeds → GitLab

If still unknown and no override flag is provided: output `NEEDS_INPUT` with an exact rerun suggestion using `--github` or `--gitlab`.
</platform_access>

<process>
  <step id="1">
    Preflight:
    - Ensure git repo; HEAD is a branch (not detached). Determine current branch name.
    - If branch is `main`/`master`: STOP (do not create PR/MR; do not auto-commit).
    - Compute `branchPath` using workspace_convention and ensure `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/` exists.
  </step>
  <step id="2">
    Ensure there are no uncommitted changes before generating the PR/MR summary:
    - If `git status --porcelain` is non-empty: you MUST invoke `@committer` now (do not ask the user; do not stop).
      - Provide commit intent hint: "checkpoint changes before PR/MR".
    - If `@committer` fails: STOP and surface the error.
    - After commit: verify `git status --porcelain` is empty; otherwise STOP.
  </step>
  <step id="3">
    CRITICAL: Ensure the branch is pushed to the remote before ANY PR/MR operation.
    The remote server cannot create a PR/MR for a branch it has never seen.

    - Check if upstream tracking branch exists: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref @{upstream} 2>/dev/null`
    - If no upstream: push with tracking: `git push -u origin HEAD`
    - If upstream exists: check if local is ahead: `git rev-list @{upstream}..HEAD --count`
      - If count > 0 (local has unpushed commits): `git push`
    - After push: verify success. If push fails: STOP and surface the error (do not proceed to PR/MR creation).

    Hard rule: Do NOT attempt to create or update a PR/MR until the branch exists on the remote with all commits pushed.
  </step>
  <step id="4">
    Load platform configuration and verify tooling/auth:
    - Read `.ai/agent/pr-instructions.md` if it exists — use the Operations Reference table for all subsequent platform commands.
    - If the file is absent: fall back to auto-detection (see platform_access).
    - Verify the platform CLI is installed and authenticated using the "Check auth" operation from the instructions (or fallback: `gh auth status` / `glab auth status`).
    - JSON parsing: require `jq`.
    If missing/auth fails: stop with a short actionable message.
  </step>
  <step id="4.1">
    Incremental rerun state:
    - Read `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/state.json` if it exists.
    - Validate against state_schema.
    - Do not decide whether to reuse/reset state until after base branch and merge-base are resolved.
  </step>
  <step id="5">
    Mandatory existence check (GATING STEP): locate an existing OPEN PR/MR for the current branch.
    Use the "List open PRs for branch" operation from `pr-instructions.md` (or fallback auto-detection commands).

    This step MUST run successfully before any create attempt.

    Persist a boolean `existedBefore`:
    - true if an open PR/MR is found for the branch
    - false only if the CLI succeeds and returns an empty result

    If multiple open PRs/MRs match the branch:
    - pick the most recently updated (deterministic)
    - capture number/IID, URL, and current base/target branch for that selected PR/MR

    Output of this step defines `mode`:
    - `mode=update` when `existedBefore=true`
    - `mode=create` when `existedBefore=false`

    Robustness rule:
    - Do NOT treat CLI invocation errors as "no PR/MR".
    - Only conclude "not found" when the CLI succeeds and returns an empty result.
    - If the command fails (non-zero exit, "Unknown flag", auth error, etc.), STOP and report the error.

  </step>
  <step id="5.1">
    Detect and fetch ticket context (if available):
    - Extract all `workItemRef` candidates from: branch name, existing PR/MR title (if updating), commit subjects in full range.
    - Deduplicate and validate format (uppercase prefix + hyphen + digits; exclude `ADR-*`).
    - If at least one valid `workItemRef` is found AND `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/tickets-context.md` does not exist (or `--refresh-tickets` flag):
      - Determine tracker type per `<tracker_detection>`.
      - Fetch ticket data via MCP per `<mcp_operations>`.
      - Write `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/tickets-context.md` per `<ticket_context_enrichment>`.
    - If MCP tools are unavailable or fetch fails: log a warning and continue (do not block PR/MR creation).
    - Store the primary `workItemRef` (first from highest-priority source) for title prefixing.
  </step>
  <step id="6">
    Resolve desired base branch:
    - If user provided `--base/--target` (or first token): use it.
    - Else if existing PR/MR exists: use its base/target branch.
    - Else: use `main` if it exists, otherwise `master`.

    If existing PR/MR base differs from desired base: update the PR/MR to target the desired base.

  </step>
  <step id="6.1">
    Define review range(s) to ensure the agent sees ALL changes before writing `description.md`:
    - Full range: `<merge-base>..HEAD` (authoritative scope)
    - If state exists:
      - If saved baseBranch or mergeBaseSha differs: reset state and treat as first run.
      - If saved `lastReviewedHeadSha` is not an ancestor of current HEAD: reset state (branch was rewritten/rebased).
    - If state exists and merge-base unchanged:
      - If `lastReviewedHeadSha == HEAD`: no new code to review
      - Else incremental range: `<lastReviewedHeadSha>..HEAD`

    Decide review strategy:
    - Always inspect commit list + stats for the full range.
    - For code-level review, prefer incremental range when available.
    - If this is the first run (or state reset): review the full range.

  </step>
  <step id="6.2">
    Large change handling (avoid context overload, but still cover all changes):
    - Compute size signals for the chosen review range: files changed, total insertions/deletions, commit count.
    - Treat as LARGE if any is true:
      - files changed > 50
      - insertions+deletions > 2000
      - commit count > 30
    - Treat as EXTREME if any is true:
      - files changed > 200
      - insertions+deletions > 15000
      - commit count > 100

    - If LARGE/EXTREME, create/update `review-plan.md` with a checklist and a chunk plan.
      Chunking rules:
      - Chunk by top-changed files first (from `git diff --numstat`), then the remainder.
      - Review in portions using bounded diffs: `git diff --unified=5 <range> -- <file|folder chunk>`.
      - After each chunk, append a short note to `review-log.md` and check off the chunk in `review-plan.md`.

    Hard requirement:
    - Do NOT write/update `description.md` until all chunks for the relevant range are reviewed.

  </step>
  <step id="6.3">
    Rerun optimization (avoid re-reviewing already-reviewed code):
    - If `review-log.md` exists, read it first and reuse it as the primary memory of already-reviewed changes.
    - If there is an incremental range, perform code-level review only for that range, but regenerate `description.md`
      for the FULL range using:
      - full-range commit list + stats
      - `review-log.md` (existing + newly appended notes)
      - (optional) `review-plan.md` if present
  </step>
  <step id="7">
    Review + generate PR/MR title + description from the diff against the resolved base:
    - Prefer diffing against `origin/<base>` when it exists; otherwise use `<base>`.
    - Compute merge-base between the chosen base ref and HEAD.
    - Inspect:
      - `git log --oneline --decorate --graph <merge-base>..HEAD`
      - `git diff --name-status <merge-base>..HEAD`
      - For code-level review: use chunked `git diff --unified=5 <range> -- <paths>` (especially when LARGE/EXTREME)
    - For large branches: do NOT load the entire unified diff at once; follow step 6.2 chunking.
    - If `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/tickets-context.md` exists:
      - Read it and use ticket descriptions to inform the `## Context (why)` section.
      - Synthesize the business rationale and requirements; do NOT copy-paste raw ticket content.
      - Reference ticket URLs where relevant.
    - Write `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/description.md` per output_contract.
    - Apply work_item_ref_detection and enforce the ticket-in-title rule when a workItemRef is available.
    - Body should be reviewer-oriented, structured, and avoid raw diffs / path dumps.

    Append a short run entry to `review-log.md` capturing:
    - baseBranch + mergeBaseSha
    - reviewed range(s)
    - high-level findings/risks

    Update state:
    - Write/overwrite `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/state.json` with: baseBranch, mergeBaseSha, lastReviewedHeadSha=HEAD, lastGeneratedHeadSha=HEAD, updatedAt.

  </step>
  <step id="8">
    Split `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/description.md` for CLI updates:
    - Title = line 1
    - Body = line 3+
    Create `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/body.md` from line 3+ (do not echo content to stdout).
  </step>
  <step id="9">
    Create or update PR/MR using the Operations Reference from `pr-instructions.md`:
    - "Create PR" / "Update PR" / "View PR (confirm)" operations.
    If `pr-instructions.md` is absent, use fallback auto-detection commands for the detected platform.

    Hard rule:
    - NEVER attempt "create" when `mode=update`.

    Update path (`mode=update`):
    - Update title + body.
    - Update base/target if needed.
    - Re-fetch the PR/MR after update to confirm URL + base/target.

    Create path (`mode=create`):
    - Create with resolved base + generated title + body.
    - If create fails with an "already exists"-type error, DO NOT claim success:
      1) re-run existence check,
      2) switch to `mode=update`,
      3) update the found PR/MR.
    - After create (or fallback update), re-fetch the PR/MR to confirm URL + base/target.

    Persist:
    - Update `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/state.json` with `platform` and `lastPrUrl`.

  </step>
  <step id="10">Report: actionTaken (created-new vs updated-existing), platform, base branch, PR/MR URL, and the written file paths under `tmp/pr/<branchPath>/`. Then STOP and ask the user to review and merge manually.</step>
</process>

<cli_reference>
For concrete CLI commands, read `.ai/agent/pr-instructions.md` — the Operations Reference table
maps each operation (list PRs, create PR, update PR, view PR, check auth) to the exact CLI command.
If `pr-instructions.md` is absent, fall back to auto-detected platform commands.

Helper patterns (platform-independent):

```bash
BRANCH="$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)"
BRANCH_PATH="$(printf '%s' "$BRANCH" | tr -c 'A-Za-z0-9._/-' '_' | sed 's#\.\.#__#g; s#^/*##')"
mkdir -p "tmp/pr/$BRANCH_PATH"

TITLE="$(head -n 1 "tmp/pr/$BRANCH_PATH/description.md")"
tail -n +3 "tmp/pr/$BRANCH_PATH/description.md" > "tmp/pr/$BRANCH_PATH/body.md"
```

Robustness rules:
- Do NOT treat CLI invocation errors as "no PR/MR".
- Only conclude "not found" when the CLI succeeds and returns an empty result.
- If the command fails (non-zero exit, auth error, etc.), STOP and report the error.
