# Code Review Instructions

Repository-specific instructions for the `code-reviewer` agent when reviewing ADOS PRs/MRs.

## Repository Context

- This repo's primary deliverables are **agent prompts** (`.opencode/agent/*.md`) and **command definitions** (`.opencode/command/*.md`). A degraded prompt degrades everything downstream — treat prompt changes with the same rigor as production code.
- XML structure is preferred for Claude models; Markdown for GPT models; JSON for DeepSeek models.
- Every Markdown file must carry a three-line YAML frontmatter: copyright, MIT license reference, and canonical URL.
- Bash scripts carry the same three lines as comments after the shebang.

## Review Priorities

1. **Prompt correctness**: Does the agent/command do what it claims? Are constraints complete? Will it produce the right output?
2. **Convention alignment**: Does the change follow ADOS patterns (naming, file layout, delegation, `tmp/` conventions)?
3. **Safety**: Does the agent respect its boundaries (read-only vs write, no auto-merge, dirty tree checks)?
4. **Consistency**: Does the new tool match sibling tools in structure and style?
5. **Documentation**: Are inventories (`.opencode/README.md`, `AGENTS.md`) updated?

## What to Ignore

- Formatting handled by CI (line length, trailing whitespace) — do not flag these.
- Minor wording preferences in documentation prose — focus on correctness over style.
- Model selection choices — these are intentional and context-dependent.

## Special Patterns

- `@pr-manager` is the reference implementation for platform detection, `branchPath` sanitization, and `tmp/` state management. New agents that interact with PR/MR platforms should mirror its patterns.
- `@toolsmith` defines quality gates for agent/command creation. Reference its `quality_gates` section when reviewing new tools.
- Change artifacts live in `doc/changes/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD--<workItemRef>--<slug>/` — never under `doc/changes/current`.
